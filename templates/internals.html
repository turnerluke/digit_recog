			<h1>
				Workflow
			</h1>
			<p>
				The Flask app is rendered on the Heroku server. When the user draws a digit and selects "Predict", JavaScript encodes the canvas into a base 64 image, which is passed to Python.
				In Python, the image is processed by CV2 and reshaped to a numpy array, which fits the input of the model.
				The processed image is passed to the model, and the output is dumped into a JSON to pass back to the JavaScript code.
				The JSON of the model prediction is then parsed back to HTML for the web page, and a descriptive report on the prediction is created.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Base HTML
			</h2>
			<p>
				All pages inherit the <a href="https://github.com/turnerluke/digit_recog/blob/main/templates/base.html">base.html</a> file. This parent HTML file sets the favicon, the css styles, the bootstrapped navigation bar, and the footer.
			</p>


			<h2>
				Drawing the Digits
			</h2>
			<p>
				The HTML canvas interfaces with <a href="https://github.com/turnerluke/digit_recog/blob/main/static/draw.js">draw.js</a> to accept the user's mouse inputs into an array.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Processing the Image
			</h2>
			<p>
				The drawn digit is passed to app.py, where it is passed to functions.py and preprocessed to fit the input of the LeNet-5 2.0 model.
				The image is processed as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Decode from base 64</li>
					<li>Convert to a numpy array</li>
					<li>Convert to black and white (remove 3rd dimension)</li>
					<li>Resize to size (32, 32) with cv2</li>
					<li>Scale to zero mean and unity standard deviation</li>
					<li>Expand dimensions to (None, 32, 32, None)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
